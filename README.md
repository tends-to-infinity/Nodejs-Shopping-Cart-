## Nodejs-Shopping-Cart

## Description
In this Project I developed an e-commerce shopping website which allows users to buy different categories of products like Books, sports, electronics, furniture.
If a customer wants to purchase something then he has to first login with his account after that he may add the items into cart and can checkout.
We also maintained the history of orders of a customer he has made so far.

## Technologies Used
#### Frontend : HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
#### Backend : Nodejs
#### Database : For storing the information about users,products and their orders I used MongoDB database.
